    <instructions>
        <instruction>
            Your primary goal is to create a new Merge Request in GitLab.
        </instruction>
        <instruction>
            **Action**: Get list of projects using the GitLab MCP tool `list_projects`. In this list find the project related to the "name" and/or "description" of the project located in the "package.json" file.
        </instruction>
        <instruction>
            **Action**: Get the project information using the GitLab MCP tool `get_project`. Use the project id to create the merge request.
        </instruction>
        <instruction>
            **Action**: Get the diff between the `{{source_branch_name}}` branch and the `{{target_branch_name}}` branch using the GitLab MCP tool `get_branch_diffs`.
        </instruction>
        <instruction>
            **Action**: Initiate the creation of a new Merge Request using the GitLab MCP tool `create_merge_request`.
        </instruction>
        <instruction>
            **Action**: Set `assignee` to `kirill.khnychkin` in the merge request creation.
        </instruction>
        <instruction>
            **Action**: Set `force_remove_source_branch: true` and `squash: true` in the merge request creation.
        </instruction>
        <instruction>
            **Source Branch**: Set the source branch for the Merge Request to `{{source_branch_name}}`.
        </instruction>
        <instruction>
            **Target Branch**: Set the target branch for the Merge Request to `{{target_branch_name}}`.
        </instruction>
        <instruction>
            **MR Title**: Set the title of the Merge Request to `{{mr_title}}`.
        </instruction>
        <instruction>
            **MR Description**:
            The Merge Request description MUST be structured as follows. Populate each section as described. The final description should be a single block of text formatted in Markdown.

            1.  **Ticket Link**:
                Start the description with the ticket link on its own line, formatted as:
                `Ticket: {{ticket_link}}`

            2.  **Summary**:
                Following the ticket link (after two newlines), add a "Summary:" heading.
                Under this heading, provide a very short and concise summary of the overall changes (1-2 sentences).
                This summary should be generated based on the diff between the `{{source_branch_name}}` branch and the `{{target_branch_name}}` branch.
                Utilize information available through the GitLab MCP or by querying GitLab to understand the commits and changes.
                Example:
                ```markdown
                Ticket: {{ticket_link}}

                **Summary:**
                This MR introduces the new user profile page and updates the authentication flow.
                ```

            3.  **Key Changes**:
                Following the Summary (after two newlines), add a "Key Changes:" heading.
                Under this heading, list the key changes made. Each item in the list MUST be very short and concise, starting with a hyphen.
                Infer these key changes from the diff and commit messages.
                Example structure:
                ```markdown
                Ticket: {{ticket_link}}

                **Summary:**
                This MR introduces the new user profile page and updates the authentication flow.

                **Key Changes:**
                - Added `UserProfile.vue` component.
                - Modified `authSaga.js` to handle new token expiration.
                - Updated routes for profile page access.
                ```
        </instruction>
        <instruction condition_variable="is_show_screenshot" condition_value="true">
            **Screenshot Section (Conditional)**:
            - If `{{is_show_screenshot}}` is `true`, append the following collapsible screenshot section to the end of the MR description (after the "Key Changes" section, following two newlines):
            ```markdown
            <details>
            <summary>Screenshots</summary>

            </details>
            ```
            - If `{{is_show_screenshot}}` is `false`, do NOT add this section.
            - Note: This section is a placeholder for manually adding screenshots later.
        </instruction>
        <instruction>
            **Tooling**: You MUST use the GitLab MCP for this entire task.
        </instruction>
        <instruction>
            **Constraint**: Do NOT use any terminal commands (e.g., `git`) for creating the Merge Request. The entire process must be done via the GitLab MCP.
        </instruction>
        <instruction>
            Once all fields (Title, Source Branch, Target Branch, and the fully structured Description) are correctly populated in the GitLab MCP, submit/create the Merge Request.
        </instruction>
        <instruction>
            **Action**: After the merge request is created, get the merge request url using the GitLab MCP and provide it to the user in a CLICKABLE LINK.
        </instruction>
    </instructions>

    <output_format>
        <format>
            The primary output of this task is the successful creation of the Merge Request in GitLab.
            Upon successful creation, please confirm with a message like:
            "Merge Request '{{mr_title}}' from branch '{{source_branch_name}}' to '{{target_branch_name}}' has been successfully created via the GitLab MCP. Link to the merge request: [merge_request_url]"
            If any errors occur or if you are unable to complete the request, report the issue clearly.
        </format>
    </output_format>

    <quality_guidelines>
        <guideline>Accuracy: Ensure the source branch, target branch, title, and description (including its precise structure, formatting, and content for each section) are set exactly as specified or generated according to instructions.</guideline>
        <guideline>Conciseness: The MR description's "Summary" and "Key Changes" items must be brief and informative.</guideline>
        <guideline>Tool Adherence: Strictly use the GitLab MCP. No terminal commands for MR creation.</guideline>
        <guideline>Conditional Logic: The screenshot section must only be included if `{{is_show_screenshot}}` is true, and it must be appended correctly.</guideline>
        <guideline>Markdown Formatting: Ensure the MR description uses correct Markdown for headings, lists, and the details element as specified.</guideline>
        <guideline>Clarity: If user input is ambiguous or missing for required fields (e.g., `{{source_branch_name}}`, `{{mr_title}}`, `{{ticket_link}}` not provided), you should indicate this as a problem rather than proceeding with default/empty values unless explicitly allowed.</guideline>
