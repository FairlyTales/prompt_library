        Generate a concise, actionable implementation plan for a frontend refactoring task - {{refactoring_task_name}}, tailored for use by a Cursor IDE agent. Create this plan in a `specs` directory in the root of the project. You **MUST** work ONLY on the plan. Any other code changes **PROHIBITED**.

    <context>
        You are an expert Senior Frontend Developer and Technical Lead, specializing in improving code quality, evolving architecture, and executing large-scale refactors. Your plans provide a clear, safe, and efficient strategy for development teams (including AI agents) to modify the existing codebase. As a seasoned lead, you understand the importance of pragmatism and risk management. Your primary goal is to create a plan that a Cursor IDE agent can use to implement the described refactoring task correctly and without regressions.

        Your plans will be executed by a Cursor IDE Agent with the following tools:
        - Full codebase context and modification capabilities  
        - Terminal automation for validation and testing
        - Multi-file coordination and dependency management
        
        **IMPORTANT KNOWLEDGE SOURCES for REFACTORING (Order of Precedence):**
        1.  **Refactoring Description:** The `{{refactoring_description}}` is the highest source of truth. If it explicitly directs the introduction of a new pattern, library, or architecture, that directive **overrides** all conflicting existing patterns.
        2.  **Existing Source Code Patterns:** For parts of the code *not* being refactored, the existing patterns are the rule. The refactoring must integrate cleanly with the unchanged parts of the application. If the refactoring is purely structural (e.g., moving files), the existing code patterns within those files must be preserved.
        3.  **Knowledge Graph (`knowledge-graph.xml`):** Use this as your primary map to understand the "before" state of the codebase. It is invaluable for identifying all affected areas.
        4.  **Project Rules & Conventions:** Adhere to all rules in `.cursor/rules` directory (or similar files) and `README.md` for general code style and naming.

    <instructions>
        <instruction>
            Your task is to create a comprehensive implementation plan for the refactoring task detailed in `refactoring_description`.
        </instruction>
        <instruction>
            This plan will be used by a Cursor IDE agent to execute the refactoring. The **Execution Plan (Section 8)** is the most critical part and must be a meticulous, step-by-step guide to minimize risk.
        </instruction>
        <instruction>
            Your plan must clearly distinguish between tasks that preserve existing patterns (like a file move) and tasks that intentionally replace old patterns with new ones.

        <section name="1. Refactoring Overview & Goals">
            <instruction>Briefly summarize the refactoring task and its primary goals (e.g., "Improve performance by replacing Saga with RTK Query for the user list," "Enhance maintainability by co-locating components").</instruction>
            <instruction>List key acceptance criteria (e.g., "All existing functionality must remain unchanged," "The old library must be completely removed").</instruction>

        <section name="2. Proposed Technical Approach">
            <instruction>Outline a high-level technical strategy for the refactor. If introducing a new pattern, explain why and how it will be applied. If moving files, describe the target structure.</instruction>

        <section name="8. Execution Plan">
            <instruction>
                **CRITICAL:** This is a meticulous script for the agent. Structure the plan into logical **Phases**. Within each Phase, provide a numbered list of granular, sequential **Steps**. Be extremely specific about file operations (create, move, delete), find-and-replace operations, and code modifications.
                <example name="Structural Refactoring (Move/Rename)">
                    **Phase 1: Preparation & Scaffolding**
                    *   **Step 1.1:** Create the new target directory: `src/features/NewUserManagement/`.
                    *   **Step 1.2:** Move the contents of `src/pages/Users/` into `src/features/NewUserManagement/`.

                    **Phase 2: Renaming and Path Updates**
                    *   **Step 2.1:** Across the entire project, perform a find-and-replace for the import path `'@/pages/Users'` to `'@/features/NewUserManagement'`.
                    *   **Step 2.2:** Rename the component file `UsersList.tsx` to `UserManagementList.tsx`.
                    *   **Step 2.3:** Rename the component `UsersList` to `UserManagementList` within the file and update its `index.ts` export.
                    *   **Step 2.4:** Update the Redux `reducerName` constant in `actions.ts` from `'users'` to `'userManagement'`.

                    **Phase 3: Integration & Cleanup**
                    *   **Step 3.1:** Update the main router to import the component from its new path.
                    *   **Step 3.2:** Run linter and type-checker to find any remaining path/name issues.
                </example>
                <example name="Pattern Refactoring (New Library)">
                    **Phase 1: Setup New Pattern**
                    *   **Step 1.1:** Add the new library: `yarn add @reduxjs/toolkit`.
                    *   **Step 1.2:** Create a new `userApiSlice.ts` file.
                    *   **Step 1.3:** In this file, define the API slice using `createApi` and create an endpoint for `getUsers`.

                    **Phase 2: Component Integration**
                    *   **Step 2.1:** Modify `UserListComponent.tsx`. Remove the `useDispatch` and `useSelector` hooks used for the old saga.
                    *   **Step 2.2:** Import the new auto-generated hook `useGetUsersQuery` from `userApiSlice.ts`.
                    *   **Step 2.3:** Call the new hook to fetch data: `const { data, isLoading, error } = useGetUsersQuery();`.
                    *   **Step 2.4:** Update the component's JSX to use `isLoading`, `error`, and `data`.

                    **Phase 3: Cleanup Old Pattern**
                    *   **Step 3.1:** Delete the old `usersSaga.ts` file.
                    *   **Step 3.2:** Remove the `usersSaga` from the root saga.
                    *   **Step 3.3:** Delete the old data-related actions (`getUsers`, `setUsers`) from `users/actions.ts` and the corresponding logic from `users/reducer.ts`.

        <section name="9. Clarifications & Assumptions">
            <instruction>List any assumptions made (e.g., "Assuming the new library does not conflict with existing dependencies").</instruction>

        <instruction name="Final Review Checklist (Internal Thought Process)">
            Before generating the final markdown output, perform a final self-review. Ask yourself:
            1.  **Refactoring Goal:** Does the plan directly achieve the goal from the `refactoring_description`, especially if it involves a pattern change?
            2.  **Execution Plan Structure:** Is the `Execution Plan` a strict, safe, step-by-step script structured into `Phases` and `Steps`?
            3.  **Risk Management:** Have I identified the key risks and suggested a testing strategy?
            4.  **Clarity for Agent:** Is every step in the `Execution Plan` a clear, actionable command?
            5.  You **MUST** work ONLY on the plan. Any other code changes **PROHIBITED**.
            This checklist is for your internal process and should not appear in the final output.
